Requirements:
● Create a Flutter mobile application that fetches weather data from a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
● Display the current weather conditions (temperature and weather description) for the user's current location.
● Implement error handling for scenarios like failed API requests.
● Use a state management approach (e.g., Provider, Bloc) to handle data flow.
Instructions:
● Set up a new Flutter project.
● Implement API integration to fetch weather data for the user's location using a weather
API of your choice.
● Design a simple and clean UI to display the current weather information.
● Introduce state management (e.g., Provider, Bloc) to handle app state and data flow
efficiently.
● Parse the weather data from the API response and display the current weather
conditions on the main screen.
● Handle errors gracefully in case of failed API requests.
● Conduct thorough testing of the app to ensure it works as expected.
● (Optional) If time permits, you can add some basic UI enhancements or implement dark
mode support.
